# FMOD For Unity

This repository contains the source code for the FMOD Studio Unity integration, excluding any platforms that require a non-disclosure agreement (such as Xbox). Additionally, native binaries for all platforms have been removed and must be acquired from a built Unity package. Developers can use this repository to track changes, report issues or submit modifications.

* Packages which include binaries can be downloaded from the Unity [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/fmod-for-unity-161631) or the FMOD [download page](https://fmod.com/download#unityintegration).
* For getting started information, up-to-date documentation and compatibility details check the FMOD For Unity [documentation site](https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-unity).
* Free support is available on the FMOD [forums](https://qa.fmod.com/c/unity) for all users, paid / licensed support available by email.
